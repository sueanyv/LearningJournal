## What we did today

We started the process to building the js. I showed the group how to use to refactor code instead of using a million for loops



I had to look up some of the button functionality i forgot like reloading the page once the button clicked and how to set buttont to send to another page. We also had some problems with the way we built our submit form. We didnt realize that it need to be a form inorder for the sumbit button to work. We built the form dynamicaly so we had to restructure our code for the button to work properly. We also have to think out the way we will write the code to check that the answers are correct.
