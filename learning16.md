# we created a project plan for the mvp

I learned what the difference between user stories and scenarios are. We learned it in class but it made a lot more sense once we started working.
The group worked on dividing the assignments and we started to break down tasks. We started to use the projects task handling and assigning each other. 
I realize that all this planning is necessary to ensure that we stay on track.
