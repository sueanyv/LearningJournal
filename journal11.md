#Learning Journal Day 11

####TODAY WE LEARNED

About creating user stories. Breaking down the needs of the person the site is for and creating the site based on that. 
We made a site about trees with two users stories. Brained stormed ideas of what each person may possibly need on the site. Looked for pictures and started to sudo code based on what we came up with.
