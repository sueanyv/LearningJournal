#Today we learned how to use github to work together on group projects. 
We went over the process of creating a repo adding multiple owners
We also learned how to create issues and us the function called blame to assign jobs or trouble shoot

Later we got together with our project group memebers to talk about our project
Together we decided on what our app should be and narrowed down ideas
We worked to gether to create our group agreement, mvp and stretch goals.
