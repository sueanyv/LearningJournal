Today we spent most of the day styling. We built alot of the form dynamically it was my first times styling something built this way. I didnt realize you could just use the inspector to find the element and style it. 
I also had issues trying to bring a im as a background image iun a div. Stephanie pointed out that I had to move directories and pay attention to the file order.
Other than that we had not other issues. Rami explained how he made the local storage work which was alot different than what stephanie did in class.
